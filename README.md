# MapLayerToLayer
If you have two custom object layers and you want both of them to be painted exactly the same, this script is for you. This places the given layer on the same positions as another layer (with the same intensity).

To run this, type this in the Parameters box:
```
NAME_OF_FROM_LAYER
NAME_OF_TO_LAYER
```
Change these to match your layer names.
The second line is the layer that gets changed.
